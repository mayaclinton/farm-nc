        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>FARM-NC</strong> (Farm-level Natural Capital) is a research project working to create a transferable and adaptable framework for Whole-Farm Natural Capital Accounting in Ireland. Our goal is to support sustainable land use, improve biodiversity, reduce flood risk, and enhance climate resilience — while recognising and supporting farmers' right to farm.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          By building farm-scale natural capital accounts, FARM-NC helps farmers integrate ecosystem services and nature-based solutions (NbS) into everyday decision-making. These accounts will also inform policy, enabling new economic and sustainability incentives for Irish farms.
        </p>
      
        <h3>Our Case Studies</h3>
        <p>
          FARM-NC focuses on three small to medium-sized farms across Ireland. These farms were selected for their diverse natural capital assets and their capacity to deliver critical ecosystem services, from carbon storage to water retention and habitat provision.
        </p>
      
        <h3>Research Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>RO1:</strong> Co-develop tools with farmers to map, measure, monitor and evaluate farm-level natural capital and ecosystem services using UAVs, ecological assessments, and water monitoring.</li>
          <li><strong>RO2:</strong> Produce detailed natural capital accounts for three case study farms, aligned with international standards such as the SEEA-EA and State-and-Transition Model.</li>
          <li><strong>RO3:</strong> Demonstrate how natural capital accounting can improve farm profitability and long-term sustainability by quantifying its economic return on investment (ROI).</li>
          <li><strong>RO4:</strong> Translate results into practical policy recommendations through direct engagement with policymakers and the publication of targeted policy briefs.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p>
          At the heart of FARM-NC is collaboration: farmers, researchers, and decision-makers working together to build a more sustainable and resilient agricultural future.
